In my mind, at this time, I could then go back to teaching with a stronger and deeper understanding of the impact of technology.\n        "},{"type":"paragraph","text":"\n        I began as a freelancer, rebuilding frontends for startups like **Wespire** and **Resolvve**, boosting performance and stability.
