        My professional path didn’t start with code. It started with logic & Philosophy.  
        After earning a **Bachelor’s in Philosophy** and a **Master’s in Pedagogy**, I spent more than a decade as an **educator and digital education advisor**, deploying tools that helped teachers impact classrooms across continents —from Europe to the Amazonian rainforest, the Caribbean to the U.S.

        Teaching taught me more than pedagogy. It trained me to communicate complexity, to stay curious, and to think systemically. It also taught me one important truth: **technology, when well-designed, unlocks potential**.

        Teaching how to research information, how to use social networks responsibly, helping teachers and students use more and more complex tools led me to learn more about User Experience in technology.
        Ultimately it led me to code my first tools, learn about accessibility, and understand the importance of performance.
        That's when I realized I wanted to build tools that help people. In my mind, at this time, I could then go back to teaching with a stronger and deeper understanding of the impact of technology.

      { type: 'paragraph', text: `
        CSS and associated frameworks have gone a long way. They offer a lot of flexibility and power. How many engineers have had a deep feeling of accomplishment when replacing hard-coded values with CSS variables?
        It feels good, it looks better, and you can now change a value everywhere with one change. But very quickly, new variables are added, engineers are reluctant to change existing variables' values because it's beyond the scope of their task and they are unsure of the consequences. Variables' power will cause their downfall. They will multiply and become unmanageable.
      `},
      { type: 'paragraph', text: `
        These variables only exist in code; their names are very often the arbitrary creation of one engineer. In most cases, you will see some variations appear: blue1 will follow blue, and primary-light will follow primary. Watch them grow into primary-lighter or blue1-darker.
      `},
      { type: 'paragraph', text: `
        The problem is that these variables are not shared. They are not part of a design system. They are not part of a shared vocabulary. They are not part of a shared understanding.
        They are not part of a shared culture. They are not part of a shared language.

      { type: 'paragraph', text: `
        This is usually the **first attempt** at solving the chaos.
        **Courageous engineers** comb through codebases and documentation in an effort to define **cross-environment styling guidelines**. 
        They consult with **engineering leads** and **code owners** to understand existing patterns and challenges. They come accross the many variables and try to establish naming conventions.
      `},
      { type: 'paragraph', text: `
        They write **documentation**. But the reality is, **guidelines aren’t enough**.

        Let's build a performant context implementation that addresses these issues. The key is to bypass React's built-in context re-rendering mechanism and implement our own subscription system.
      `},
      { type: 'paragraph', text: `
        Here's how we can create a fast context that only re-renders components when their specific data changes:

        Our fast context implementation uses several key techniques:
      `},
      { type: 'list', items: [
        '**Reference-based state**: Use useRef instead of useState to prevent Provider re-renders',
        '**Manual subscription system**: Implement custom listeners with Set for O(1) operations',

        '**Selective subscriptions**: Components only subscribe to their specific data needs',
        '**Immutable updates**: Ensure referential equality for unchanged state portions'

      `},
      { type: 'list', items: [
        '**Store**: A lightweight state container with get, set, and subscribe methods',
        '**Provider**: A component that creates and provides the store without re-rendering',
        '**Hooks**: useSelector for reading state and useSet for updating state'
      ]},
      { type: 'paragraph', text: `
        The store uses useRef to maintain state, preventing the Provider from re-rendering when state changes. Instead, it manually notifies subscribers through a custom subscription system.
      `},

        React Context is a powerful tool, but it comes with performance trade-offs. By implementing a fast context pattern, we can maintain the simplicity and developer experience of Context while achieving the performance characteristics of external state management libraries.

        The key insight is that we don\'t need to rely on React\'s built-in context re-rendering mechanism. By implementing our own subscription system and using useSyncExternalStore, we can create a context that only re-renders components when their specific data changes.

        This approach scales well and provides predictable performance characteristics, making it suitable for large, performance-critical applications. The implementation is relatively simple but provides significant performance benefits.
